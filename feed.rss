			<link>/FAO/posts/Ep.%252002%2520-%2520Press%2520Whos%2520Coming%2520to%2520Dinner</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who are these people with their microphones, notepads, and cameras? And where do they get the right to stick their noses in… oh, never mind. The press plays an important role in our society. They can also be unbearably annoying. We talk about some of the more pivotal moments in the history of the free press (except for Deep throat).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
